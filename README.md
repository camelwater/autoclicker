java autoclicker + automover

the autoclicker part is pretty self-explanatory, but what is the automover?\
all it does is randomly move your mouse pointer. useful for when you're not at your computer, but you need to keep a session that closes if there's a certain period of inactivity open.

i'm thinking of adding the ability to customize the toggle keys/buttons (the autoclicker toggle is middle mouse click and the automover toggle is LALT), but too lazy to right now. maybe when i'm bored or something
